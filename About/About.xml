[h1]Orcish opinions:[/h1]
- Orcs are loud, and heavy, sleepers and will not suffer 'sleep disturbed' penalty
- Orcs receive smaller mood penalties for living in a barracks (den), and smaller mood bonuses for living in a private room (burrow)
- Orcs care little for non-clan members and do not suffer penalties involving the mistreatment or death of prisoners.
- Orcs receive much smaller mood penalties for ugly enviroments, but little to no mood bonuses for beautiful enviroments
-Although a cooked meal is good,  orcs will gladly eat their meals raw.

-Large plate leggings

Additonally orcs have access to crude oversized weapons:
