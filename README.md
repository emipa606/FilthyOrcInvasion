From lands unknown, this mod introduces the ruthless orc clans to RimWorld.

# Typical traits:

- Cannibal (guaranteed)

- Staggeringly ugly

# Orcish opinions:

- Orcs are loud, and heavy, sleepers and will not suffer 'sleep disturbed' penalty
- Orcs receive smaller mood penalties for living in a barracks (den), and smaller mood bonuses for living in a private room (burrow)
- Orcs care little for non-clan members and do not suffer penalties involving the mistreatment or death of prisoners.
- Orcs receive much smaller mood penalties for ugly enviroments, but little to no mood bonuses for beautiful enviroments
-Although a cooked meal is good,  orcs will gladly eat their meals raw.

# Equipment:

Because of their size and shape orcs cannot use human atire and instead have their own apparel:
-Loincloth
-Large embossed leather vest
-Large hide pants 
-Large chest piece
-Orcish plate helm
-Large breastplate
-Large plate leggings

Additonally orcs have access to crude oversized weapons:
-Great club
-Great maul
-Great Axe
-Throwing Axes
-Javelin
-Hand cannon

# Buildings:

-Stake (a more decrotive grave replacement)
-Fighting ring (a joy building that improves melee skill)

This mod is still very much a work in progress and new content will be added periodically.
